This web app: New features has been added to this app to make it more appealing for students to use. Students can now try to guess the correct answer before checking it, and they can also move to the next or previous cards. Their answer doesn't also need to be exactly the same as the answer at the back of the card. A student gets an answer right as long as it's correct.
